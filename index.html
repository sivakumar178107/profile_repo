          <p class="about-description">
            Originally from the lush landscapes of Kerala in India, a region often described as 'God's own country' for its tranquil beauty and harmonious melding of diverse cultures, Jinson's story is a testament to the power of dedication and the universal language of care. In Kerala, known for its impressive literacy rate, Jinson embarked on his noble journey in English Medium institutions, establishments nurtured by the caring hands of Catholic priests and nuns. His academic pursuits culminated in a Bachelor's degree in Nursing and Midwifery, and with remarkable swiftness, he earned his eligibility certificate from the Australian Health Practitioners Regulatory Authority.

            With his destiny calling from across the seas, Jinson arrived in Australia mere months after his internship in Intensive Coronary Care Unit in 2011. There, he not only completed an adaptation program but also earned the esteemed AHPRA registration, embarking on a career as a Registered Nurse. His clinical odyssey took him through the vital corridors of Tertiary Hospitals, into the adrenaline-fueled Emergency Department, and the deeply challenging realms of Mental Health and Alcohol and Other Drug Services.
            
            As a beacon of compassion, Jinson excelled as a Senior Assessment Clinician under the Northern Territory's Alcohol Mandatory Treatment Act. His acumen shone through as he conducted thorough assessments and presented his thoughtful recommendations to the NT CAT tribunal. His dedication to mental wellbeing saw him in the front lines at the Royal Darwin Hospital and within Community Crisis Mental Health Teams, his expertise growing with each life he touched.
            
            The year 2017 marked Jinson's ascent into leadership as he became the clinical nurse consultant/Team Leader of the Mental Health Access Team, a role that had him overseeing the crucial nursing care for referrals across the Greater Darwin Region. His leadership prowess did not go unnoticed, propelling him to the position of Team Manager by 2019, and later, ascending to the role of Operations Manager in 2020, for his outstanding performance.
            
            In his directorial capacities, Jinson became the steward of inpatient mental health units, crisis teams, and alcohol and drug service withdrawal units. Today, as the Director of Recovery and Rehabilitation Services, his responsibilities span across the community mental health and AOD teams, as well as Forensic Mental Health and Forensic Disability Services throughout the Northern Territory. His wisdom and guidance have been pivotal in acting roles up to the Executive Director level in the Top End Mental Health Alcohol and Other Drug Services.
            
            Educationally, Jinson continued to ascend, achieving a Master of Mental Health Nursing from The University of Newcastle in 2016 and honing his leadership skills with a Postgraduate Certificate in Leadership from The University of Tasmania in 2021 and graduating from the Australian Institute of Company Directors in 2023.
            
            Instrumental in pioneering projects that broke new ground in mental health care, Jinson has been a cornerstone in the creation of innovative services within the Grater Darwin Region. His strategic foresight was instrumental in the expansion of the mental health inpatient units and the visionary design of new mental health facilities.
            
            Notably, Jinson has been involved in shaping key models of care, such as those addressing Volatile Substance Abuse, the Assertive Community Treatment Team, and the Stabilisation Assessment and Referral Area. Perhaps one of his greatest contributions lies in his natural ability to foster leadership, coaching and nurturing the next generation of health care trailblazers.
            
            Jinson's journey is more than a career; it is a calling that has touched the hearts of many, a narrative of leadership interwoven with the deepest threads of empathy and careâ€”a tale that truly resonates with the soul of 'God's own country', where his story began.
            
            Alongside his professional endeavours, Jinson's heart beats strong for community engagement, a testament to his unwavering commitment to service. Even amidst the rigors of his demanding career, he served with passion in various capacities within the Darwin Malayalee Association. His dedication saw him hold the financial reins as Treasurer in 2016/17, become the voice of the community as the Public Relations Officer in 2021/22, provide organisational guidance as Secretary in 2022/23, and lead with vision as President in 2023/24.
            
            Jinson's rich professional tapestry is matched by the warmth of his family life. He shares his journey with his wife Anu, a Clinical Nurse Consultant/Nurse Practitioner candidate at NT Health whose dedication mirrors his own. She is currently furthering her expertise by pursuing Nurse Practitioner studies at Charles Darwin University, balancing her academic pursuits with a full-time career. Their home is brightened by the laughter and dreams of their children, Aimie, a diligent Year 6 student, and Anna, who brings joy and curiosity from her transition year. Together, they create a family portrait that is underpinned by shared values of care, learning, and community spirit.
            
            Jinson's story is further enriched by his family's deeply rooted political heritage in Kerala, India. This background has imbued him with a sense of civic responsibility and a profound understanding of community service.
            
            His father, Charles Antony, has been a significant figure in Kerala's cooperative movement. As the former General Secretary (2009-2019) of the Kerala Cooperative Employees Front, Charles Antony led an organisation with a staggering 17,000 members. His influence extended to key governmental roles, including being appointed as a Director on the Cooperative Employees Welfare Board and the Cooperative Employeesâ€™ Pension Board by the Kerala State Government, positions he held with distinction from 2009 to 2019.
            
            Jinson's uncle, Anto Antony, further exemplifies the family's political legacy. A respected Member of the Indian Parliament since 2009, representing Pathanamthitta and its 1.2 million constituents, Anto Antony's contributions have been multifaceted. His tenure included serving as a member of the Indian Nursing Council, representing elected parliamentarians from 2009 to 2014. His international representation for India at the United Nations General Assembly in 2014 stands as a highlight of his global engagement. Domestically, he has been an active member of several key committees, including those on External Affairs, Energy, Transport, Tourism and Culture, and Government Assurances, reflecting his diverse interests and expertise in national affairs.
            
            This rich political tapestry in Jinson's family background not only underscores a legacy of service and leadership but also highlights a deep-seated commitment to social and community development, values that Jinson himself embodies in his professional and personal life.
